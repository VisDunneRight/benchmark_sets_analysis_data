# Benchmark Datasets

A collection of datasets used in graph visualization research, as well as graph format conversion code and analysis code. See <https://osf.io/j7ucv/> for more details on the related publication and supplemental materials.

Authors: [Connor Wilson](https://vis.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/Connor-Wilson/) (corresponding author) and [Eduardo Puerta](https://vis.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/Eduardo-Puerta/)

## Analysis and Conversion

The `src` directory contains all of our code. In particular, `file_conversions.py` has individual functions for each of the datasets analyzed which extracts the node-link structure from the raw data and stores it in a standard JSON format. `analysis.py` contains auxiliary functions to calculate statistics for the datasets, as well as code which takes the JSON data generated by `file_conversions.py` and converts it to our three other data formats: GraphML, GEXF, and GML. Shell scripts used to refactor and zip the files are also included.

## Data

The `data` directory contains all files downloaded directly from the source, if they were not too big to be stored on GitHub. For further information, please visit [our website](https://visdunneright.github.io/gd_benchmark_sets/), which contains links to all sources as well as links to file downloads which were created by the code in this repository.
